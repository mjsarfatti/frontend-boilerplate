# frontend-boilerplate

A Gulp-ES6-Webpack-BrowserSync starter template for frontend development.
Feel free to edit the folders in the settings of `gulpfile.js` to adapt it to
your development environemnt.

### Quick start

*NOTE:* You must have [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md)) installed

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mjsarfatti/frontend-boilerplate
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

### What it does

- convert your ES6 files to ES5, concatenate and minify them
- convert your SCSS files to CSS, autoprefix, concatenate and minify them
- watch your JS and reload the browser on change
- watch your CSS and inject the new rules on change
- watch your HTML and PHP and reload the browser on change
- provide a server at localhost:3000 and 192.168.my.ip:3000
- make sure all browsers find the polyfills for Promise and fetch
- and moreâ€¦ check *gulpfile.js* out!

### The available commands, explained

```sh
# run Gulp in development mode (does not minify your JS for quicker response,
# will write 'dirty' in a build.txt file), start the server, open a new browser
# tab at localhost:3000 and start watching files
$ gulp
```

```sh
# all of the above, but do not open a new tab (this is just a utility in case
# you already have the tab open)
$ gulp watch
```

```sh
# run Gulp in production mode (does minify your JS, will write the current
# date and time in the build.txt file, will not start any server or watch)
$ gulp build
```

#### Why the build.txt file?

Let's assume that you have a post-receive hook on your server that deploys your
files at every push. You can implement a pre-receive hook that will block the
push if it encounters a build.txt file with the word 'dirty', which means that
the developer has forgotten to launch a *gulp build* before committing and
pushing. Here a sample pre-receive hook:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

check() {
    if git diff-tree --name-only -r -z $oldrev $newrev -- build.txt; then
        echo -e "\n"
        build=$(git cat-file blob $newrev:build.txt)
        if [[ $build =~ "dirty" ]]; then
            echo "\nERROR:"
            echo "*** You forgot to < $ gulp build > ! ***"
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
}

while read oldrev newrev ref
do
    case $ref in
    refs/heads/master) check $master_tree master;;
    refs/heads/staging) check $staging_tree staging;;
    esac
done
```
