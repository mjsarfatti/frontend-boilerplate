# frontend-boilerplate

A Gulp-React-ES2015-Webpack-BrowserSync starter template for frontend
development. Feel free to edit the folders in the settings of `gulpfile.js` to
adapt it to your development environment. Note that React and ES2015 are
optional, you can keep writing regular ES5 javascript.

### Quick start

**NOTE:** You must have [node](https://nodejs.org/) and [gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) installed

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/mjsarfatti/frontend-boilerplate my-project
# or (if you want to simply copy the files without the .git repo)
$ svn export https://github.com/mjsarfatti/frontend-boilerplate/trunk my-project
# then:
$ cd my-project
$ npm update --save-dev
$ gulp
```

_PS: You probably want to personalize the first 4 properties of `package.json`
even though it's not required_

### What it does

- convert your JSX (react) into proper JS
- convert your ES2015 files to ES5, concatenate and minify them
- convert your SCSS files to CSS, autoprefix, concatenate and minify them
- watch your JS and reload the browser on change
- watch your CSS and inject the new rules on change
- watch your HTML and PHP and reload the browser on change
- provide a server at localhost:3000 and 192.168.my.ip:3000
- make sure all browsers find the polyfills for Promise and fetch
- and moreâ€¦ check `gulpfile.js` out!

### The available commands, explained

```sh
# run Gulp in development mode (does not minify your JS for quicker response,
# will write 'dirty' in a build.txt file), start the server, open a new browser
# tab at localhost:3000 and start watching files
$ gulp
```

```sh
# all of the above, but do not open a new tab (this is just a utility in case
# you already have the tab open)
$ gulp watch
```

```sh
# run Gulp in production mode (does minify your JS, will write the current
# date and time in the build.txt file, will not start any server or watch)
$ gulp build
```

```sh
# sometimes you just want to have a quick look at the project: this will simply
# start the server and open a new browser tab at localhost:3000
$ gulp serve
```

#### Why the build.txt file?

Let's assume that you have a post-receive hook on your server that deploys your
files at every push. You can implement a pre-receive hook that will block the
push if it encounters a build.txt file with the word 'dirty', which means that
the developer has forgotten to launch a **gulp build** before committing and
pushing. Here a sample pre-receive hook:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

check() {
    if git diff-tree --name-only -r -z $oldrev $newrev -- build.txt; then
        echo -e "\n"
        build=$(git cat-file blob $newrev:build.txt)
        if [[ $build =~ "dirty" ]]; then
            echo "\nERROR:"
            echo "*** You forgot to < $ gulp build > ! ***"
            exit 1
        fi
    fi
}

while read oldrev newrev ref
do
    case $ref in
    refs/heads/master) check $master_tree master;;
    refs/heads/staging) check $staging_tree staging;;
    esac
done
```
